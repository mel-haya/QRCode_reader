# Project Setup Instructions

## 📁 Environment Variables

Each folder (`frontend` and `backend`) contains a `.env.example` file.

➡️ **Before running the project**, rename each one to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server in production mode
npm run start
```

## 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
